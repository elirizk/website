In simple terms, RSA computes a large integer from the product of two large primes (<code>n = p.q</code>), and derives the public and private keys from the prime factors. In particular the public key <code>e</code> is chosen such that <code>gcd(e, (p-1).(q-1)) = 1</code> and the private key <code>d</code> is derived as <code>d</code> is the inverse of <code>e</code> modulo <code>(p-1).(q-1)</code>. The RSA schema assumes that <code>n</code> and <code>e</code> are public while the prime factors and the private key are kept secret. It’s easy to see from the formulas that given <code>n</code>’s prime factors and the public key, one can easily derive the private key. Hence, it is of utmost importance to the security of the algorithm that it is “hard” to factorize a large integer. Otherwise, the security of the schema is broken.

Therefore, our above limitation can be easily expanded to solve the general problem of integer factorization. While primality testing can be achieved in the order of ```log(n)```, no classical polynomial-time algorithm for integer decomposition is known.\n\n## Brute-Force Factorization with the Sieve of Eratosthenes\n\nWe will start with a naïve implementation of our factorization algorithm. We will start by listing all primes less than $n$ and check which prime in that list is a divisor. An improvement would be to only check primes less than or equal to the square root of ```n``` because the number is a product of two primes, so the smaller prime has to be less than or equal to its square root.\n\nWe will use the sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes in a specific range. This approach goes through all numbers starting from 2 to the end of the range and progressively removes all other that are multiples of it. We end up with a list of primes, all that is left is to check the first one that divides ```n```.\n\n```python\nimport math  \n  \ndef naive(n):  \n    sqrt_n = int(math.sqrt(n))  \n  \n    isPrime = [True for i in range(0,sqrt_n+1)]  \n    primes = []  \n  \n    for p in range(2, sqrt_n+1):  \n        if isPrime[p]:  \n            primes.append(p)  \n            for x in range(p**2, sqrt_n+1, p):  \n                isPrime[x] = False  \n      \n    prime1 = 0  \n    for p in primes:  \n        if n%p == 0:  \n            prime1 = p  \n            break  \n    return prime1\n```\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe code above will factorize the integer ```n``` by building up the list of primes up to the square root of ```n```, and checking whether any of these primes divide ```n```. This algorithm has a log-linear every-case time complexity. Its proof is shown below:\n\nOrder notation of the brute-force algorithm\n\nIts space complexity is in the order of square root of ```n``` (since we have to keep track of all numbers less than the square root of ```n```).\n\n## Pollard’s Rho\n\nThis algorithm is implemented in a very simple manner but is based on a pseudorandom sequence.

The algorithm proceeds by progressively applying the polynomial function on a starting seed value (usually 2) and checking once two different random numbers are congruent to the same value modulo ```n```. If so, the prime is simply the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers.\n\nThis approach can be thought of as a form of branch and bound where the state space tree are all pairs of numbers ```(x,y)```, this pair is considered promising once its difference (in absolute value) isn’t co-prime with n anymore.\n\n```python\nimport math  \n  \ndef g(x,n): return (x**2 + 1)%n  \n  \ndef rho(n):  \n    x = 2  \n    y = x  \n    d = 1  \n    while (d==1):  \n        x = g(x,n)  \n        y = g(g(y,n),n)  \n        d = math.gcd(abs(x-y), n)  \n    return d\n```\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe algorithm highly depends on the pseudorandom nature of the polynomial function modulo ```n```. If this randomness is assumed, we base our analysis on the birthday paradox.

We also correctly determined that Pollard’s Rho space requirement is constant, independent of the input size, while the brute force implementation requires additional space as the size of the input increases to store the list of primes.\n\nWe can also plot the time needed to executed with respect to the size of the input N as you can see below (blue plot is for the naïve implementation and the red one is for Pollard’s Rho):\n\nPlotting execution time against the input (right) and its size (left)\n\nThis is exponential in the size of N (measured as the number of bits in the binary representation of ```n```, i.e., ```~ log(n)``` ), but log-linear with N.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we can see how two different approaches to solve the problem of integer factorization can result in different time and space complexities. While the brute force algorithm is deterministic and allows to compute a list of primes as it is solving the problem, it is very inefficient in terms of time and space requirements. On the other hand, Pollard’s Rho algorithm is very efficient in terms of time and space, but it is based on a pseudorandom sequence and doesn’t have an absolute guarantee on factorizing an integer. In fact, proving the time-complexity of Pollard’s Rho is still an open problem in mathematics and computer science.\n\nWhile the problem of large integer factorization has been explored for decades, no efficient algorithm has been found on classical computers yet. This has led to cryptographic schemas to rely on the difficulty of integer factoring for the confidentiality of the encrypted data. However, efficient quantum algorithms for integer factorization has been proven to exist. And as quantum computers are evolving to be more reliable and faster, efficiently factoring an integer might become a thing of the past.";
