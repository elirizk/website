Throughout my research, I had to develop custom training algorithms, model architectures and evaluation metrics. Doing independent research has proven to be a difficult yet rewarding journey, where I was constantly reading state of the art research, learning new concepts and applying novel techniques. I am looking forward to having my work published on the Deep Blue archive of the University of Michigan.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the The Fulbright Program for sponsoring my graduate education and stay here in the United States. I would also like to acknowledge my advisor Birhanu Eshete for providing me with valuable feedback throughout the process and the computing resources needed to run my experiments. Finally, a special thanks goes to Di M., Srijita Das and Ang Li for serving as committee members for my defense.\n\nCheck my published thesis at https://dx.doi.org/10.7302/22653.\n\nGo Blue!";
