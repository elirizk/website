const html = "<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>Static code analysis tools have come a long way in the past decade. Multiple tools have been developed to run on top of application’s code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, or general inefficiencies. For example, Spotbugs has tremendously increased in popularity due to its wide support of bug discovery for Java code. In contrast, Joern provides a general static code analysis tool that supports multiple languages, including C++, Java, and PHP.</p>\n<h2 id=\"code-property-graphs\">Code Property Graphs</h2>\n<p>In order to extract the multiple properties of source code (e.g., variable names, data dependencies, function calls and definitions, etc…), we will have to obtain an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the code. IR is vastly used by compilers to transform high-level code to low-level machine instructions and perform different types of enhancements on the code before turning it into an executable. IR includes different types of graphs, mainly: Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Data/Program Dependence Graph (DDG or PDG). Let’s talk about the details of each below.</p>\n<p>We will use the following C++ example to illustrate the differences of each graph type:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> foo</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">()  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">{  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">  int</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> x </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> source</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">  if</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (x </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">&#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> MAX)  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  {   </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    int</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> y </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 2</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> \\</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">*</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> x;  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    sink</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(y);  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  }  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>You can think of the source function as a way to obtain user input and the sink function as a sensitive function that needs to be safeguarded against malicious input (e.g., database query, printing a value on a webpage, etc…)</p>\n<p>Parsing this code, we can obtain the AST, CFG, or PDG graphs. The AST will use the language semantics to fill the graph nodes while preserving a true representation of the original code semantics; it also maintains the order in which statements were originally written in the code. The CFG showcases how the execution of the code can move between statements (which aren’t necessarily next to each other in the original code). It is mainly useful for representing if-else statements, for and while loops, break statements, etc… For example, the execution of the C++ code above can jump from evaluating the if condition to exiting the program if the condition evaluates to False, this possible execution will be displayed in the CFG. The PDG will highlight any dependencies on the data between different variables, function calls, conditions, etc… For example, the variable definition <em>x</em> in the third line is used in the if condition and to define <em>y</em>, so data dependency edges will be added to display the flow of data from one statement to another. The AST, CFG, and PDG graphs are shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/assets/joern/graphs.png\" alt=\"AST, CFG, PDG of the C++ code\"></p>\n<p>While each code representation has its advantages, it is also limiting. For instance, ASTs provide a true representation of the code but it’s hard to find data dependencies between different statements. To resolve these conflicting issues, Code Property Graphs (CPG) were invented to merge these three different graphs which will greatly simplify traversing the code and accessing multiple properties we might seek for discovering bugs, vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies. The CPG graph of the C++ code is presented below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/src/assets/joern/cpg.png\" alt=\"CPG of the C++ code\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"joern\">Joern</h2>\n<p>Joern parses the application code to obtain a Code Property Graph and allows developers to customize their needs as graph traversal algorithms on top of this graph.</p>\n<p>To install joern, you can execute the following code on a Linux / Ubuntu system:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">mkdir</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> joern</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> &#x26;&#x26; </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">cd</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> joern</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\"> # optional  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">curl</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> -L</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"https://github.com/joernio/joern/releases/latest/download/joern-install.sh\"</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> -o</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> joern-install.sh</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">chmod</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> u+x</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> joern-install.sh</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">./joern-install.sh</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> --interactive</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>By default, joern will be installed at <em>~/bin/joern</em>, Once installed, you can run joern in a command prompt as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">cd</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> &#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">path</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">\\_</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">to</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">\\_</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">joer</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">n</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">></span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">/joern/joern-cli</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">./joern</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>Once the joern terminal is open, it will provide you with an interactive way to parse source code and traverse its graph.
