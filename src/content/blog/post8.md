I'm thrilled to share that I recently took part in my university's 3-minute thesis presentations. In just under three minutes, I had the opportunity to present my Masterâ€™s thesis work to a panel of judges spanning various fields of study. Over the past year, I've been immersed in developing a robust framework aimed at ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning, focusing on key objectives such as privacy, robustness, fairness, and accuracy. Participating in this competition was an incredible experience, allowing me to succinctly convey the essence of my research approach and its impactful results.
