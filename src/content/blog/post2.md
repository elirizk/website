I am proud to have received the Mark Sawaya Excellence Award in Computer Science, as the undergraduate Computer Science student with the highest cumulative GPA. I would like to thank my professors who have always guided and helped me throughout my academic journey. I couldnâ€™t have made it without their full support!
